    <h1>CV Alejandra Castellanos</h1>
    <p>
        I am currently studying the Software Analysis and Development program at SENA. In addition, I have a solid background as
        a Senior Business Management Specialist and Metallurgical Engineer. My commitment to the continuous enrichment of my
        knowledge and skills throughout my professional career has been fundamental to my growth.
        
        My proactive approach, open mindedness and willingness to collaborate allow me to fully integrate myself in the
        processes, acting with responsibility and service vocation. My commitment to efficiency and professional ethics is
        non-negotiable, and I am convinced that I can contribute in an integral way to the success of any project in which I
        participate.
